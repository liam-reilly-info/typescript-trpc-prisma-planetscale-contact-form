# www.liam-reilly.info/blog project

This repository contains the source code for a blog [post](https://www.liam-reilly.info/blog/post/contact-form-planet-scale/).

The post shows how to build a simple `<ContactForm>` that accepts input from the user and posts it to a database that is hosted on [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/).

There is a second component `<SubmissionsGrid>` which fetches any rows of data from the database and renders them on the screen.

The project is a complete web app built with the following technologies:

* React
* NextJS
* TypeScript
* tRPC
* Prisma
* Tailwind CSS
* Zod
* PlanetScale
